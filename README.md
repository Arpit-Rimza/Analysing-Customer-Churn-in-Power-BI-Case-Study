# Analysing-Customer-Churn-in-Power-BI-Case-Study

For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. In this Power BI case study, I investigated a dataset from an example telecom company called Databel and analysed their churn rates. Analysing churn does not just mean knowing what the churn rate is; it is also about figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn. I have answered these questions by creating measures and calculated columns, while simultaneously creating insightful Power BI report pages.
